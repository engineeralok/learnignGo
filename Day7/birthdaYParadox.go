/*

Write a GO program that uses random number generation to solve a classical probability problem.

Assume a room with 20 people. What is the probability that two of them have the same birthday?
For simplicity, say a year has 365 days.
Day 1 is January 1 and day 365 is December 31.

So, a birthday will be a number from 1 to 365.  Now compute whether 20 people at random will have the same birthday.
Do this 10000 times to get a reasonable sample.
Also do this for 10, 20, 30 ,.. 100 people in the room and print this as a table.  So the output should be:

People in the room       Probability of 2 (or more) having the same birthday

10                                          0.xyz

20                                          0.xyz

â€¦

A typical bar bet is made on where the probability is greater than one-half.
